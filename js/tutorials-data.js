/* The video guides on the Help page. This is the only file you need to edit to add a video.

   Each entry is one card. An entry with no video yet shows as "Coming soon". To publish one, add ONE of these lines to it:

     youtube: "dQw4w9WgXcQ"                  the code after v= in a YouTube link (upload it as "Unlisted" if you don't want it searchable)
     vimeo:   "123456789"                    the number in a Vimeo link
     file:    "videos/first-election.mp4"    a video file you put in the videos folder (keep it under about 90 MB for free hosting)

   Optional on any entry:
     length:   "6 min"
     level:    "Start here"
     poster:   "videos/first-election.jpg"   a picture shown before a video file is played
     captions: "videos/first-election.vtt"   subtitles for a video file (YouTube and Vimeo have their own captions)

   Move an entry up or down to change the order. Save, and refresh the Help page. */
